Is it fine to use many visualisations in the literature review? | Tom | Yes, that's completely fine. Things like the model architectures would be shown in the section on background, but other visualisations can appear in the literature review. 
Ultimately, how important is the accuracy of our models to our mark? | Doug | It's not. It's good if your model is highly accurate, but it's not a component of the final mark, as there's no guarantee that the results of the various projects would be easily comparable. What matters is the documentation. We should show how we got our results and will receive marks for our descriptions of the models and results. If we do want to review the accuracy, we can use the AEMO model results as a baseline.
