Do we need to do 15 minutes for the presentation? | Doug | Yes, the presentation length will not be reduced for smaller groups. So, we need to present roughly five minutes each. We should not spend excessive amounts of time on the slides. The most important part is what we say and how well we speak, though we should try to keep it simple.
Will updates of the visualisations from our project plan suffice for the report | Doug | Yes. The visualisations are good and need only be updated with the final data to be included.
Farewells | All | We thanked Rohit for his help throughout the project. He wished us good luck with the last stretch and let us know to stop by if we're ever on campus.
